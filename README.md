# UPNHBS
Unique Prime Numbers “Hidden” in Binary Strings
# What is it?
This coursework is a group project for the 2024/25 academic year, contributing 100% to your final grade. It is designed to evaluate your ability to select and implement data structures, analyze algorithm complexity, and optimize solutions.

Task: "Unique Prime Numbers Hidden in Binary Strings"
You must develop a Python program that extracts all unique prime numbers from a given binary string and ensures they are less than a given integer, N.

Example Input & Output
Input: "0110", 5

Process: Extract all substrings → Convert them to decimal → Identify prime numbers

Output: 2: 2, 3

(Extracted primes: 2 ("10"), 3 ("11"))

If fewer than 6 prime numbers are found, print them all.

If 6 or more prime numbers are found, display the first three smallest and the last three largest.

Test Cases
You are given 10 test cases, some involving binary representations of words like "COMP1819!ADS". You need to determine the corresponding prime numbers from these binary sequences.
